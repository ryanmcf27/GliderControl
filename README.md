# GliderControl
Code to control the gradual descent of the X-1 glider into the scoring zone for Iowa State University's 2024-2025 Design Build Fly (DBF) team.

This repository contains both the team's custom code for glider control, as well as a directory containing Nick Rehm's open source dRehmFlight software and our customized use case for it. More info about this dRehmFlight software can be found at its GitHub repository here: https://github.com/nickrehm/dRehmFlight/tree/master
