# GliderControl
Code to control the gradual descent of the X-1 glider into the scoring zone for Iowa State University's 2024-2025 Design Build Fly (DBF) team.

This repository contains both the team's custom code for glider control, code to test the glider's individual componenets,
and helpful references such as hardware datasheets and  Nick Rehm's open source dRehmFlight. More info about this dRehmFlight software can be found at its GitHub repository here: https://github.com/nickrehm/dRehmFlight/tree/master
